## Summary Statistics

- **Total Files to Process**: ~458 Dart files
- **Files Completed**: 1 (test_notification_widget.dart)
- **Estimated Hardcoded Strings**: 300-500+
- **New Translation Keys Needed**: ~200-300

## Recommendation

Due to the large scope, I suggest:

1. **Prioritize by Module**: Start with user-facing screens (presentation layer) before utility widgets
2. **Batch Processing**: Process related files together (e.g., all tracking files, all wallet files)
3. **Testing**: Test each module after translation to ensure no broken strings
4. **Use Find & Replace Carefully**: Many strings appear in multiple files with similar patterns

## Next Steps

1. Add all the keys from this document to `assets/translations/en.json`
2. Process files systematically by directory
3. Use `import 'package:get/get.dart' hide Trans;` pattern for files using both GetX and easy_localization
4. Test after each major section is completed
