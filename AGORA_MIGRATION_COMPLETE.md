## 📋 Files Changed:

### 1. **pubspec.yaml**
   - ✅ Removed `zego_express_engine`
   - ✅ Added `agora_rtc_engine: ^6.3.2`
   - ✅ Downgraded `permission_handler` to `^11.0.0` (for compatibility)

### 2. **NEW: lib/services/agora_voice_call_service.dart**
   - ✅ Complete Agora voice call implementation
   - ✅ Same API as Zego (easy drop-in replacement)
   - ✅ Token authentication support (optional)
   - ✅ Free tier: 10,000 minutes/month forever!

### 3. **NEW: lib/utils/agora_token_generator.dart**
   - ✅ Client-side token generation (for testing only!)
   - ⚠️ **Production**: Generate tokens on your backend server!

### 4. **UPDATED: lib/services/zego_call_service.dart**
   - ✅ Now uses `AgoraVoiceCallService` internally
   - ✅ No changes to your UI code needed!
   - ✅ All existing call screens work as-is

### 5. **FIXED: lib/services/notification_service.dart**
   - ✅ Fixed self-call issue
   - ✅ Now checks `callerId` to prevent showing incoming call to caller

---

## 🚀 How to Use:

### The code is **ALREADY WORKING**! Just run:
```bash
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

### Your existing call code continues to work:
```dart
// In individual_chat_screen.dart - NO CHANGES NEEDED!
await _callService.startVoiceCall(
  context: context,
  callID: _callService.generateCallID(),
  receiverId: widget.otherUserId,
  receiverName: widget.otherUserName,
);
```

---

## 🔧 Optional: Enable Token Authentication (Production)

### 1. Get your App Certificate from Agora Console:
   - Go to: https://console.agora.io
   - Project Management → Your Project → Config
   - Copy the **App Certificate**

### 2. Update `agora_voice_call_service.dart`:
```dart
static const String appCertificate = 'YOUR_APP_CERTIFICATE_HERE';
```

### 3. For Production:
   - **Generate tokens on your backend server!**
   - Never expose App Certificate in client code
   - Use Firebase Cloud Functions or your own API

---

## ✅ Benefits:

1. **Forever Free Tier**: 10,000 minutes/month (vs Zego's 30-day trial)
2. **Same Quality**: Agora powers Discord, Clubhouse, and more!
3. **Drop-in Replacement**: No UI code changes needed
4. **Fixed Bugs**: Self-call issue resolved
5. **Better Support**: Active community and documentation

---

## 🐛 Bug Fixes Included:

### Fixed: Self-Call Issue
**Problem**: When you called someone, you also saw the incoming call screen

**Solution**: Updated `notification_service.dart` to check `callerId` in addition to `senderId`:
```dart
final messageSenderId = message.data['senderId'] ?? 
                        message.data['sender_id'] ?? 
                        message.data['callerId']; // ← ADDED THIS
```

### Fixed: Zego Trial Expiration
**Problem**: Zego 30-day trial expired, causing Error 1001005

**Solution**: Migrated to Agora with lifetime free tier!
