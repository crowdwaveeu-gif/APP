# Email & KYC Fix Implementation Summary

## Date: October 22, 2025

## Issues Fixed ‚úÖ

### 1. Duplicate Email Issue
**Problem**: Users were receiving 2 emails when signing up:
- Empty email from Firebase Auth trigger (`sendEmailVerification`)
- Proper OTP email from Cloud Function (`sendOTPEmail`)

**Solution**:
- Disabled the `sendEmailVerification` Firebase Auth trigger
- Kept only the `sendOTPEmail` function for email verification
- Updated exports in both `email_functions.js` and `index.js`

**Result**: Users now receive only ONE email with the OTP code

---

### 2. Wrong Logo in Emails
**Problem**: Emails were using emoji "üåä CrowdWave" instead of the actual logo

**Solution**:
- Updated email templates to use proper CrowdWave logo
- Logo URL: `https://crowdwave-website-live.vercel.app/assets/images/CrowdWaveLogo.png`
- Added proper styling (200px width, centered, with tagline)
- Updated both verification and password reset email templates

**Result**: Emails now display the professional CrowdWave logo

---

### 3. OTP Expiration Time Verification
**Status**: ‚úÖ CONFIRMED CORRECT

- OTP expiration is set to 10 minutes (as designed)
- Location: `lib/services/otp_service.dart` lines 38 and 167
- Email template correctly states "This code expires in 10 minutes"

---

### 4. Post Package KYC Check Missing
**Problem**: Post Package button didn't have KYC verification check like Post Trip button

**Solution**:
- Added `_kycCheckComplete` state variable to home screen
- Updated `_checkKycStatus()` method to track completion
- Implemented full KYC verification flow in Post Package button:
  - Waits for KYC check to complete
  - Shows loading message during check
  - Displays friendly verification dialog if not approved
  - Only proceeds to post package if KYC is approved
- Added debug logging for troubleshooting

**Result**: Post Package now has the same security as Post Trip

   _kycCheckComplete: true
   _kycStatus: approved
   _hasSubmittedKyc: true
