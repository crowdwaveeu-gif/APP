# Email Duplicate & Logo Issues - FIXED ‚úÖ

## Issues Identified & Fixed

### 1. **Duplicate Emails Problem** ‚úÖ FIXED
- **Issue**: Users receiving 2 emails when signing up
  - First email: Empty/incomplete from `sendEmailVerification` Firebase Auth trigger
  - Second email: Good email with OTP from `sendOTPEmail` Cloud Function

- **Root Cause**: The `sendEmailVerification` function (lines 565-610 in `email_functions.js`) was a Firebase Auth trigger that automatically fired when a new user was created. This was meant for the old email/link verification system, but now we're using OTP codes instead.

- **Solution Applied**: 
  - Disabled the `sendEmailVerification` Firebase Auth trigger by commenting it out
  - Removed the export from `module.exports` in `email_functions.js`
  - Removed the export from `index.js`
  - Now only the `sendOTPEmail` function sends verification emails

### 2. **Wrong Logo Issue** ‚úÖ FIXED
- **Issue**: Using emoji "üåä CrowdWave" as logo instead of actual CrowdWave logo
- **Solution Applied**: 
  - Updated email templates to use proper CrowdWave logo hosted at:
    `https://crowdwave-website-live.vercel.app/assets/images/CrowdWaveLogo.png`
  - Updated both `email_verification` and `password_reset` email templates
  - Logo is now displayed as an image with proper styling

### 3. **OTP Expiration Time** ‚úÖ CONFIRMED
- **Confirmed**: 10 minutes expiration is correct
- Set in `otp_service.dart` line 38 and 167
- Email template correctly states "This code expires in 10 minutes"

### 4. **Post Package KYC Check** ‚úÖ FIXED
- **Issue**: Post Package button in home screen didn't have KYC verification check like Post Trip button
- **Solution Applied**:
  - Added `_kycCheckComplete` flag to track KYC check completion
  - Updated `_checkKycStatus()` to set `_kycCheckComplete = true` after check
  - Implemented full KYC check logic in Post Package button (same as Post Trip)
  - Shows loading message while checking KYC status
  - Shows verification dialog if KYC not approved
  - Only allows posting package if KYC is approved
